//! Crate-wide test-only helpers for the process-global egress environment.
//!
//! `NEXUS_EGRESS_ALLOWLIST` and `NEXUS_EGRESS_ALLOW_PRIVATE` are read by
//! `EgressPolicy::from_env`, which every AEON client construction goes through.
//! Tests in more than one module mutate them, and `cargo test` runs the unit tests
//! of every module as threads of a *single* process — so the mutex governing them
//! has to be one crate-wide mutex.
//!
//! TEST-1: previously `src/aeon.rs` and `src/hypervisor/mod.rs` each declared their
//! own module-local `EGRESS_ENV_LOCK`. Two distinct mutexes over one process-global
//! resource provide no mutual exclusion against each other, so a `hypervisor::tests`
//! writer setting `NEXUS_EGRESS_ALLOW_PRIVATE="not-a-bool"` could be observed by a
//! concurrent reader, which then panicked with
//! `ConfigError("NEXUS_EGRESS_ALLOW_PRIVATE must be one of: 0, 1, true, false")`.
//! Reproduced at 12/20 runs under default test parallelism, 0/5 single-threaded.
