# RecallEnvelopeV2 — normative protocol (S0.1)

Language-neutral specification of the AEON-IQ recall attestation contract.
The Rust implementation in `crates/aeon_nexus_bridge` is **one conforming
implementation**, not the definition. Where prose and code disagree, this
document and the checked-in vectors are authoritative.

- `protocol_version` — `aeon-recall-envelope-v2`
- `canonicalization_version` — `aeon-canonical-json-v1`

---

## 1. Structures

### 1.1 Envelope

```
RecallEnvelopeV2 {
  payload:   RecallEnvelopeV2Payload
  signature: RecallSignatureV2
}
```

`payload.protocol_version` is authoritative and is **not** duplicated at
envelope level. There is deliberately no second copy that could disagree with
it.

### 1.2 Payload

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `protocol_version` | string | exactly `aeon-recall-envelope-v2` |
| `canonicalization_version` | string | exactly `aeon-canonical-json-v1` |
| `request_id` | canonical UUID | §3 |
| `nonce` | string | 64 lowercase hex chars = 32 random bytes |
| `issued_at_unix_ms` | signed 64-bit integer | ≥ 0, milliseconds since Unix epoch |
| `expires_at_unix_ms` | signed 64-bit integer | > `issued_at_unix_ms` |
| `tenant_id` | opaque id | required, non-empty, §10 |
| `workspace_id` | opaque id \| null | nullable |
| `agent_id` | opaque id | required, non-empty, §10 |
| `session_id` | opaque id \| null | nullable |
| `mission_id` | opaque id \| null | nullable |
| `run_id` | canonical UUID | §3 |
| `query_digest` | digest | §6 |
| `limit` | integer | 1 ≤ limit ≤ 100 |
| `retrieval_policy_digest` | digest | SHA-256, caller-defined preimage |
| `embedding_config_digest` | digest | SHA-256, caller-defined preimage |
| `hits` | array | ordered, 0–100 entries |

### 1.3 Hit

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `memory_id` | opaque id | non-empty, unique within the envelope |
| `memory_version_id` | opaque id | non-empty, unique within the envelope |
| `content_digest` | digest | SHA-256 over the memory content bytes |
| `rank` | integer | zero-based; equals the hit's array index |
| `score_micros` | signed 64-bit integer \| null | fixed point; §11 |
| `provenance_digest` | digest \| null | §12 |
| `authority_label` | string \| null | §12 |

### 1.4 Digest

```
{ "algorithm": "sha256", "value": <64 lowercase hex>, "public_recomputable": <bool> }
```

This is a closed object: all three members are required, unknown members are
rejected, and duplicate known members are rejected. `algorithm` accepts only
the exact lowercase string `sha256`.

#### 1.4.1 `public_recomputable`

`public_recomputable` is `true` **only** when a verifier possessing the public
evidence package holds both the exact preimage bytes and the frozen derivation
procedure needed to recompute `value` and compare it. If either is missing it
MUST be `false`.

It is a statement about reproducibility from public inputs, and nothing else.
It is specifically **not**:

- an authority label, or any claim about how trustworthy the digest is;
- a permission, capability, or access-control decision;
- an instruction to disclose, publish, or withhold the preimage;
- a correctness guarantee — a digest marked `true` can still be wrong, and
  recomputation by the verifier is precisely what catches that;
- a claim that any external resource holding the preimage is, or will remain,
  available.

`signature.signed_payload_digest.public_recomputable` is fixed at `true` and a
different value MUST fail closed (§7). Its preimage is `signing_bytes`, derived
entirely from the transmitted payload and the frozen domain constant, so every
verifier can always recompute it.

Every other digest location — `query_digest`, `retrieval_policy_digest`,
`embedding_config_digest`, `hits[].content_digest`, `hits[].provenance_digest` —
MAY be `true` or `false`. The producer MUST set each one according to whether
that digest's actual preimage travels in the public evidence package: a recall
that digests raw query text which is never transmitted sets `false`; one that
digests a published retrieval policy sets `true`. Both are valid wire values and
a verifier MUST NOT reject either.

### 1.5 Signature

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `algorithm` | string | exactly `ed25519` |
| `key_id` | string | non-empty |
| `signature` | string | exactly 128 lowercase hex chars (64 bytes) |
| `signed_payload_digest` | digest | §7; `public_recomputable` is exactly `true` |
| `signing_domain` | string | exactly `AEON_RECALL_ENVELOPE_V2` |

`signing_domain` is a declarative echo of the frozen label, never
caller-selectable. A mismatch MUST fail closed.

---

## 2. Optional fields: null, never absent

**Every optional key MUST be present.** Absence of the value is encoded as
explicit JSON `null`. An absent key is invalid and MUST be rejected.

Applies to: `workspace_id`, `session_id`, `mission_id`, `score_micros`,
`provenance_digest`, `authority_label`.

Rationale: `{...}` and `{"session_id":null,...}` are different byte strings and
therefore produce different signatures. Permitting both would let two
implementations agree on the meaning while disagreeing on the digest.

> Implementation note. In Rust this is *not* expressible with `Option<T>`:
> serde's derive silently maps a missing field to `None`. The reference
> implementation uses a field-level `deserialize_with` function on each
> `Nullable<T>`, with no `default`. Present values deserialize directly from the
> original Serde stream. Other languages must apply an equivalent presence check.

---

## 3. Canonical UUID

`request_id` and `run_id` MUST be **canonical lowercase hyphenated** form:
exactly 36 characters, lowercase hex, hyphens at offsets 8, 13, 18, 23.

The following MUST be rejected even though they parse to the same 128-bit
value:

| Form | Example |
| --- | --- |
| uppercase | `3F2504E0-4F89-41D3-9A0C-0305E82C3301` |
| mixed case | `3f2504E0-4f89-41d3-9a0c-0305e82c3301` |
| simple | `3f2504e04f8941d39a0c0305e82c3301` |
| braced | `{3f2504e0-...-0305e82c3301}` |
| urn:uuid | `urn:uuid:3f2504e0-...-0305e82c3301` |

A permissive UUID parser is **not** sufficient. Validate the string form before
parsing. JSON Schema uses an explicit `pattern`, not `format: uuid`, which is
annotation-only in most validators.

---

## 4. Canonicalization — `aeon-canonical-json-v1`

Defined by this document. It is **not** RFC 8785 / JCS and MUST NOT be
described as such.

1. Serialize the payload to a JSON value.
2. Object keys are emitted in ascending order of their **raw UTF-8 key bytes**.
3. Array order is preserved. Arrays are never sorted.
4. No insignificant whitespace: no space after `:` or `,`, no newlines.
5. Strings preserve the exact Unicode scalar sequence. No normalization is
   performed. Ordinary non-ASCII scalars are emitted directly as UTF-8.
6. String escaping is exact:
   - quote is `\"`;
   - backslash is `\\`;
   - U+0008, U+0009, U+000A, U+000C, and U+000D are `\b`, `\t`, `\n`, `\f`,
     and `\r`;
   - every other U+0000 through U+001F scalar is lowercase `\u00xx`;
   - slash is not escaped;
   - U+2028 and U+2029 are emitted directly as UTF-8.
7. A lone UTF-16 surrogate is not a Unicode scalar and MUST be rejected by the
   JSON parser before canonicalization.
8. **Numbers MUST be integers at the lexical token level.** Before conversion to
   a generic JSON value or JSON Schema validation, inspect the raw input and
   require every JSON number token to match `-?(0|[1-9][0-9]*)`. Any token with
   a decimal point or exponent marker (`e` or `E`) MUST be rejected, including
   mathematically integral spellings such as `10.0` and `1e1`. JSON Schema
   draft 2020-12 uses mathematical value semantics for `type: integer`, so the
   schema alone is not a sufficient lexical gate. The normative cases are in
   `vectors/recall_envelope_v2/number_tokens.json`.
9. Duplicate object keys MUST be rejected before canonicalization.

Key ordering MUST be performed explicitly, not inherited from a language's map
type. (In Rust, `serde_json::Map` ordering depends on the `preserve_order`
feature, which any transitive dependency can enable.)

---

## 5. Duplicate keys

A JSON object containing the same key twice MUST be rejected at parse time,
including when both occurrences are *known* fields. Rejecting only unknown
fields is insufficient. Note that parsing into a generic JSON value type
typically keeps the last occurrence silently — the check must happen during
strict deserialization.

The rule applies recursively to the payload, every hit, every digest, the
signature object, and the outer envelope. Nullable values do not create an
exception: a present object is deserialized directly into its strict target type.

---

## 6. Query digest preimage

```
query_digest = SHA-256( <exact UTF-8 bytes of the query string> )
```

No trimming, case folding, Unicode normalization, or whitespace collapsing.
The raw query bytes as issued.

---

## 7. Signing bytes and `signed_payload_digest`

Two frozen constants:

```
RECALL_SIGNING_DOMAIN_LABEL = "AEON_RECALL_ENVELOPE_V2"
RECALL_SIGNING_DOMAIN_BYTES = 41 45 4f 4e 5f 52 45 43 41 4c 4c 5f 45 4e 56 45
                              4c 4f 50 45 5f 56 32 00
```

The label is what travels on the wire. The bytes — **including the trailing
`0x00`** — are what the cryptography commits to.

```
signing_bytes         = RECALL_SIGNING_DOMAIN_BYTES || canonical(payload)
signed_payload_digest = SHA-256( signing_bytes )
```

`signed_payload_digest` is the digest of the **signing bytes**, not of
`canonical(payload)` alone, so it inherits domain separation. Its
`public_recomputable` member MUST be `true`: the payload and frozen domain bytes
are public inputs, so every verifier can recompute this digest. The digest of the
bare canonical payload MUST NOT be placed in a signature envelope. (The test
vector publishes it as `payload_digest_diagnostic` purely so the two values can
be compared; it is not part of the contract.)

### 7.1 What is and is not signed

**Only `canonical(payload)` is included in the signing bytes.** The outer
`RecallEnvelopeV2` object — the `payload` / `signature` wrapper — is *not*
canonicalized and *not* signed. Nothing in the `signature` object is covered by
its own signature.

Consequently:

- **The outer envelope's JSON object-key order is NOT security-significant.**
  `{"payload":…,"signature":…}` and `{"signature":…,"payload":…}` are equally
  valid and carry identical security properties. Do not infer meaning from it,
  do not canonicalize the outer object, and do not hash the transmitted envelope
  bytes as a substitute for the procedure in §8.
- The same holds for whitespace and formatting of the transmitted envelope: it
  is transport representation, not signed content.

**Consumers MUST parse the envelope structurally and independently
re-canonicalize the payload before verifying the digest or the signature.**
Concretely: deserialize the envelope into typed fields, take the `payload`
*value*, run §4 canonicalization over it yourself, prepend the domain bytes per
§7, and verify against that. A verifier MUST NOT:

- extract the payload as a raw substring of the received JSON and hash those
  bytes;
- reuse the sender's byte framing in any form;
- trust `signed_payload_digest` in place of recomputation.

The payload's canonical form is a function of its *values*, not of how the
sender happened to serialize them. Any conforming implementation re-deriving it
from parsed values arrives at identical bytes — that is the entire point of §4,
and it is why an intermediary may reformat the envelope in transit without
invalidating the signature.

---

## 8. Signature procedure

**Producer**

1. Build and validate the payload (§9).
2. `canonical(payload)` per §4.
3. `signing_bytes` per §7.
4. Ed25519-sign `signing_bytes`. Encode lowercase hex.
5. Emit `signature` with `algorithm = "ed25519"`,
   `signing_domain = "AEON_RECALL_ENVELOPE_V2"`,
   `signed_payload_digest = SHA-256(signing_bytes)`.

**Verifier**

1. Inspect raw JSON number tokens per §4 and reject any non-integer spelling.
2. Parse strictly; reject unknown fields, duplicate keys, absent optional keys.
3. Validate payload shape (§9) and signature shape (§1.5).
4. Recompute `canonical(payload)` and `signing_bytes` from the received payload.
5. Recompute `SHA-256(signing_bytes)`; reject on mismatch with
   `signed_payload_digest`.
6. Verify the Ed25519 signature over the **recomputed** signing bytes, using a
   key selected by `key_id` from a trusted keyring — never from the envelope.

A verifier MUST NOT trust `signed_payload_digest` in place of recomputation, and
MUST NOT accept an `algorithm` other than `ed25519`.

## 9. Validation rules

| Rule | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| versions | `protocol_version` and `canonicalization_version` exact match |
| nonce | exactly 64 lowercase hex chars |
| time | 0 <= issued_at_unix_ms < expires_at_unix_ms <= 9223372036854775807 |
| TTL | `expires_at − issued_at ≤ 120000 ms`; default 30000 ms |
| limit | `1 ≤ limit ≤ 100` |
| hits | `0 ≤ len(hits) ≤ 100` and `len(hits) ≤ limit` |
| rank | `hits[i].rank == i`, zero-based and contiguous |
| uniqueness | all `memory_id` unique; all `memory_version_id` unique |
| identifiers | required ids non-empty; a present optional id must be non-empty |
| digests | `algorithm = "sha256"`, 64 lowercase hex chars |
| signed payload digest | `public_recomputable = true` |
| other digests | `public_recomputable` set per §1.4.1; both values are valid |
| unknown fields | rejected |
| numbers | raw token matches `-?(0|[1-9][0-9]*)`; schema validation alone is insufficient |

Empty `hits` is valid and signable: a recall that returned nothing is a real,
attestable event.

**Clock skew is NOT validated here.** `issued_at`/`expires_at` are checked only
for internal consistency and TTL bound. Comparing them to a wall clock is
verifier policy (S0.1c).

---

## 10. Identifier privacy

`tenant_id` and `agent_id` are **stable opaque identifiers**. They MUST NOT
contain display names, email addresses, or other unnecessary personal data.
They appear in signed bytes that may be shared outside the issuing system.

Note that V1 (`aeon-nexus-memory-evidence-v1`) carried an HMAC'd
`agent_handle` rather than a raw identifier. V2 carries the identifier
directly; producers SHOULD keep supplying pseudonymous values so the practical
privacy posture is preserved.

---

## 11. Scores

`score_micros` is a signed 64-bit fixed-point integer in millionths, inclusive
from `-9223372036854775808` through `9223372036854775807`. Values outside this
range MUST be rejected. For example, `0.875` is `875000`.

`null` means **no score**. It MUST NOT be replaced with `0`, and no
floating-point value may enter canonical bytes.

---

## 12. Per-hit provenance and authority

`provenance_digest` and `authority_label` are **per hit**, not per envelope, and
are covered by canonical bytes and the signature.

`null` means:

- no authenticated provenance claim, and
- no authenticated authority claim — semantically **AUTH_0**.

`null` never means "unknown" or "not yet computed". Populating either field on a
hit that previously carried `null` changes the signing bytes and invalidates any
existing signature. That is intentional: an authority claim cannot be added
after the fact without re-signing.

---

## 13. What S0.1 does NOT provide

- **No replay protection.** The nonce and validity window are carried and
  format-checked, but nonce reuse is not tracked and timestamps are not compared
  to a clock. V2 provides the *contract* a replay guard enforces; it is not
  itself a replay guard.
- **No signing.** The reference implementation defines the signature envelope
  and computes signing bytes. It holds no key material and performs no runtime
  signing.
- **No verification.** It checks internal consistency —
  `signed_payload_digest == SHA-256(signing_bytes)` — which is not signature
  verification.
- **No key management**: no keyring, rotation, distribution, or `key_id`
  resolution.
- **No transport, storage, or persistence.**

## 14. Deferred

**S0.1b (AEON-IQ producer)** — populate real values; sign with a managed key;
vendor the schema and vectors below and pass byte-for-byte conformance;
preserve pseudonymous identifiers (§10).

**S0.1c (Nexus verifier)** — resolve `key_id` against a trusted keyring; verify
signatures; enforce clock skew and the validity window; enforce nonce
uniqueness (replay storage); define failure and audit behaviour.

Stage 0.2 remains the event chain. Stage 0.3 remains snapshot consistency.

---

## 15. Source artifacts

The authoritative hashes live in **one machine-readable file**:

```
vectors/recall_envelope_v2/MANIFEST.sha256
```

standard `sha256sum` format, paths relative to the crate root, covering:

- `schema/recall_envelope_v2.schema.json`
- `schema/recall_envelope_v2/PROTOCOL.md`
- `vectors/recall_envelope_v2/payload.json`
- `vectors/recall_envelope_v2/vector.json`
- `vectors/recall_envelope_v2/envelope.json`
- `vectors/recall_envelope_v2/canonicalization_strings.json`
- `vectors/recall_envelope_v2/number_tokens.json`

They are deliberately **not** duplicated in this document. A second copy would
drift, and a stale hash in a normative spec is worse than none. The test
`artifact_manifest_matches_checked_in_files` recomputes every entry, so editing
a fixture or the schema fails the build until the manifest is deliberately
updated.

Vendoring parties MUST record, alongside the copied files:

1. the source Nexus commit SHA,
2. the contents of `MANIFEST.sha256`,

and MUST re-verify those hashes after copying.

`.gitattributes` in the crate pins `eol=lf` for `schema/**` and `vectors/**`.
These files are hashed byte-for-byte, so a CRLF checkout would invalidate every
entry without changing any content.

The Ed25519 key in the vectors is a fixed all-`0x42` test seed. It protects
nothing and MUST NOT appear in any real system.

**V1 compatibility baseline.** `aeon-nexus-memory-evidence-v1` is unchanged by
this contract: not deprecated, not converted, byte-identical on the wire.
Verified against untouched `Nexus-temp` main at commit
`971fdfcd9b242ac69404d3c27b1821f971ab10b4`.
