-- Rollback for migration 0041 (tenancy tranche 1 constraint attachment).
--
-- Apply manually:
--     psql "$DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 \
--       -f rollback/0041_tenancy_tranche1_constraints_down.sql
--
-- MIGRATION ORDER.  Full unwind order for tranche 1 is 0041 -> 0033-0040 -> 0032.
-- This script must run first: migrations 0033-0040 build indexes that 0041
-- adopts as constraints, and 0032's columns cannot be dropped while any of
-- these constraints reference them.
--
-- WHAT THIS REVERSES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT.
-- Drops the five composite ownership foreign keys and the three unique
-- constraints 0041 attached.  Dropping a UNIQUE constraint also drops the index
-- it adopted -- that is PostgreSQL's behaviour for an adopted index, not an
-- oversight here, and it is why 0033-0040's rollback drops those three names
-- only IF EXISTS.
--
-- Deliberately NOT resolved with `DROP ... CASCADE`: nothing here needs it, and
-- cascading from an ownership constraint would reach into whatever a later
-- tranche has since attached.
--
-- NO DATA IS LOST.  Every ownership value written by the bridge triggers stays
-- in its column; only the constraints enforcing consistency are removed.
--
-- DROPS ONLY WHAT IT OWNS.  A name is not a claim of ownership.  Every drop
-- below is preceded by proving that the constraint holding the name IS the
-- object migration 0041 creates -- same kind, same ordered local columns, same
-- target table and target columns, same referential actions, same match type,
-- same deferrability, not partition-inherited.  If a same-named object is
-- present but different, this script raises and drops NOTHING: an unrelated
-- CHECK constraint called `entities_tenant_agent_fkey`, or a foreign key an
-- operator added by hand, belongs to whoever created it.  `DROP CONSTRAINT IF
-- EXISTS` by name alone would have deleted it silently.
--
-- The same identity test lives in migration 0041.  It is written out in both
-- files rather than shared, because sqlx has no include mechanism and a rollback
-- that depended on an object the forward migration installs could not run after
-- that object had been removed.
--
-- RENAME-PROOF DISCOVERY.  The tranche's foreign keys are found from the parent
-- side, by OID: every one of them is backed by `agents_tenant_id_id_key`, so
-- `conindid` identifies them whatever their own table is called now.  That
-- matters because `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME` moves a table without touching its
-- constraint names, while the drops below name tables literally.  Discovering by
-- (name, table-name) finds nothing for a renamed child, lets the script proceed,
-- and fails later on a raw "relation does not exist" -- or, in the sibling 0033
-- script, drops indexes that survived the rename.  Detected here, it refuses up
-- front and names the table that moved.
--
-- SAFE TO RE-RUN.  A constraint that is already gone is skipped.
BEGIN;

-- Never trust the caller's session search_path.  Without this a schema placed
