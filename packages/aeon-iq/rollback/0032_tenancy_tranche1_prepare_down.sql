-- Rollback for migration 0032 (tenancy tranche 1 PREPARE).
--
-- Apply manually:
--     psql "$DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 \
--       -f rollback/0032_tenancy_tranche1_prepare_down.sql
--
-- MIGRATION ORDER.  Full unwind order is 0041 -> 0033-0040 -> 0032, and this is
-- the last step.  The guard below refuses while any later part of the tranche
-- is still applied, naming what to run first.
--
-- WHAT IS LOST.  This is the one destructive step in the tranche, and it is
-- destructive in exactly two ways, both stated rather than discovered:
--
--   1. Dropping agent_uuid and tenant_id discards every ownership value the
--      bridge triggers and the backfill wrote.  Re-running the tranche
--      re-derives all of it from `agents`, which remains the authority, so
--      nothing unrecoverable is lost -- but the backfill must run again, and on
--      a large deployment that is hours, not seconds.
--
--   1b. Any COMPLETED checkpoint for this tranche is transitioned to ABANDONED
--      before the columns go. That is a loss of *authority*, not of history:
--      the row, its counts and its digest all survive, but it can no longer
--      satisfy a FINALIZE guard describing ownership this script just deleted.
--      See the block that does it, below, for why leaving it COMPLETED breaks
--      in both directions.
--
--   2. Dropping tenancy_backfill_checkpoints discards the backfill history,
--      including ABANDONED attempts.  That history is diagnostic evidence about
--      what an operator did and when.  This script therefore does NOT drop it
--      by default: the table is preserved, and the guarded block at the foot
--      explains how to remove it deliberately.  A rollback that silently
--      destroys the record of why a rollback was needed is a bad trade.
--
-- Deliberately NOT resolved with `DROP ... CASCADE` anywhere.
--
-- SAFE TO RE-RUN.  Every statement is IF EXISTS, and the provenance guard only
-- fires on an object that is PRESENT and unstamped, so a second run over an
-- already-unwound schema finds nothing to object to.
