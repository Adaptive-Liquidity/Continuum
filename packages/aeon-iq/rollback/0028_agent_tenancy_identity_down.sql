-- Rollback for migration 0028 (agent identity rework).
--
-- Returns the schema to the 0027 baseline.  Kept outside `migrations/` on
-- purpose: this repository uses sqlx's non-reversible migration naming
-- (`NNNN_name.sql`), so a `.down.sql` sibling inside that directory would make
-- the whole set inconsistent.  Apply manually:
--
--     psql "$DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 \
--       -f rollback/0028_agent_tenancy_identity_down.sql
--
-- No identifier is lost.  0028 added columns and a record table but never
-- modified, moved or deleted pre-existing data, and it left `agents.agent_id`
-- and its global UNIQUE constraint alone, so every V1 row and relationship
-- survives the round trip untouched.
--
-- Rows created through the tenant-aware path need one extra step.  Their
-- `agent_id` is a compatibility key (the row's UUID), not the caller-facing
-- identifier, which lives in `external_agent_id`.  Dropping that column without
-- restoring it first would leave the agent reachable only by a UUID it never
-- advertised, and re-applying 0028 would then backfill `external_agent_id` from
-- the UUID — an identifier no operator input reproduces.  The first block below
-- therefore moves the caller-facing identifier back into `agent_id`, which also
-- means it briefly drops and re-creates the two foreign keys that reference
-- that column (`sessions.agent_id`, `archival_batches.agent_id`) — see the
-- comment on that block for why.  Both come back with their original
-- definitions, and the block is skipped entirely when no identifier has moved,
-- which is every step-1 deployment.
--
-- Where the baseline schema genuinely cannot hold the data — two tenants
-- sharing one `external_agent_id`, which is exactly what the global UNIQUE on
-- `agent_id` forbids — this script raises instead of picking a winner.
--
-- What IS discarded: tenant assignments held in `agents.tenant_id` and the
-- audit rows in `agent_tenancy_migrations`.  Re-running the backfill after
-- re-applying 0028 reproduces them from the same operator inputs, because the
-- assignment is a pure function of the declared mode and mapping.

-- Checked per constraint rather than by testing for one table, because the five
-- are attached by a single migration but dropped by a rollback an operator
-- could have run partially.  Naming which ones are still present is what turns
-- this from "something depends on it" into a next action.
--
-- The bridge FUNCTIONS are checked as well as the constraints, and that is the
-- load-bearing half.  The five `fn_*_tenancy_bridge` bodies read
-- `agents.tenant_id` and `agents.id` directly, so they depend on this rollback's
-- work whether or not any foreign key does.  Checking constraints alone left a
-- real hole, measured on pg16: roll back 0041 only -- which drops all five
-- foreign keys but leaves 0032's triggers and columns in place -- and a
-- constraint-only guard is satisfied. This script would then drop
-- `agents.tenant_id` while five BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE triggers still select
-- it, and every subsequent write to those five tables fails with
-- `column a.tenant_id does not exist`. The database would be left accepting no
-- writes at all on five tables, from a rollback that reported success.
