//! Credential authentication (plan §2, decision A-1) — step 2 of the AEON
//! authentication & tenancy plan accepted at
//! `Adaptive-Liquidity/nexus-planning @ b1fe06505d400e435c3ef8d10dc197f15641bebd`.
//!
//! # What this step does
//!
//! Establishes *who is calling*: a credential registry, the
//! `<credential_id>.<secret>` format, HMAC verification against a pepper held
//! outside the database, scopes, revocation, a bounded cache, and an audit
//! record per attempt.
//!
//! # What it deliberately does not do
//!
//! Nothing here decides *what the caller may reach*. There is no route
//! enforcement, no tenant predicate on any query, and no agent authorization —
//! those are plan steps 3 and 5. In particular [`AeonAuthContext`] carries no
//! agent identifier; see `context.rs` for why.
//!
//! # Inert by default
//!
//! With `AEON_CREDENTIAL_AUTH_ENABLED` unset, [`CredentialAuthSettings::build`]
//! returns `None`, no pepper is required, no authenticator exists and no
//! request path changes. `MANAGEMENT_API_KEY` continues to be the only
//! authentication in effect. An existing V1 deployment upgraded to this build
//! starts and behaves exactly as before.

// Most of this surface is called by plan step 5 (per-route scope and grant
// enforcement), which has not landed. Until it does, the authenticator is
// constructed at startup but nothing routes through it, so `dead_code` would
// fire on nearly every item here and on all five submodules.
//
// Allowed once at module scope, with that expiry stated, rather than scattered
// per item where the reason would be lost. The cost is real and worth naming:
// genuinely unused code inside this module will not be flagged until step 5
// removes this attribute.
