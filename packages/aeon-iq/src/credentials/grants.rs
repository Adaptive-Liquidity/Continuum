//! Agent grants (plan §2.2, §10 step 3).
//!
//! Authentication established *who is calling*. This establishes *which agents
//! they may act for* — a separate control, because tenant isolation does not
//! imply agent authorization. Without it, any valid credential could name any
//! agent in its own tenant and satisfy every route's tenant+agent predicate,
//! which is the cross-agent hole plan test #5 forbids.
//!
//! # The two modes, and the two states that are not modes
//!
//! | Credential | Grant rows | `tenant_wide` | Result |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | Agent-restricted | ≥1 | `false` | may act only for the granted agents |
//! | Tenant-wide | 0 | `true` | may act for any agent **in its own tenant** |
//! | *Unconfigured* | 0 | `false` | **denied** — this is the fail-closed default |
//! | *Contradictory* | ≥1 | `true` | **denied**, loudly |
//!
//! The unconfigured row is why `credentials.tenant_wide` defaults to `false`:
//! forgetting to add grants denies rather than permits.
//!
//! The contradictory row asserts both "all agents" and "these agents".
//! Resolving it toward tenant-wide would let a stray flag quietly widen a
//! restricted credential; resolving it toward the grants would let a flag
//! intended as tenant-wide be silently narrowed. Migration 0030 makes it
//! unrepresentable with a pair of triggers; [`authorize_agent`] refuses it
//! anyway, because a database whose triggers were disabled or restored from a
//! drifted dump is exactly when a second line matters.
//!
//! # Not wired to any route
//!
//! Nothing here is consulted on a request path. Route enforcement — resolving
//! `external_agent_id` within the authenticated tenant, then requiring a grant,
//! then running the tenant-scoped query, all returning one identical not-found
//! — is plan step 5.
