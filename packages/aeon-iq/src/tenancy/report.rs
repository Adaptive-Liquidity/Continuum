//! ## What must never appear here
//!
//! The audit reads tables holding memory content, retrieval queries, provider
//! output, credential MACs and embeddings. None of that belongs in a
//! diagnostic report, so the report model has no field that could carry it:
//! findings carry counts, reason codes, and a *safe identifier* that is either
//! a UUID/numeric surrogate key or a domain-separated SHA-256 pseudonym of a
//! caller-controlled text key. There is no free-text field derived
//! from row values anywhere in this file, which is what makes the
//! confidentiality tests a check on a structural property rather than on a
//! filter that could be forgotten.
