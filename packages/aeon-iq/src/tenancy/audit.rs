//! The read-only tenancy mismatch scanner.
//!
//! Step 4A's diagnostic gate. It answers one question per row — *which tenant
//! authoritatively owns this?* — and reports every row it cannot answer for.
//! It changes nothing: no `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `MERGE`, DDL, ledger
//! write or repair. That is enforced by PostgreSQL, not by convention: the
//! whole run happens inside [`AUDIT_TRANSACTION`].
//!
//! `READ ONLY` is what makes a stray write fail rather than succeed quietly.
//! `REPEATABLE READ` is what makes the report *coherent*: under the default
//! `READ COMMITTED` every statement takes a fresh snapshot, so a parent could
//! be read before a concurrent commit and its child after it, and the audit
//! would report a cross-tenant link that never existed. One snapshot for one
//! report.
//!
//! ## The identifier boundary
//!
//! The scanner builds its queries from [`inventory::REGISTRY`] rather than
//! carrying twenty-two hand-written ownership queries, which would be
//! twenty-two places for the rule to drift from the registry documenting it.
//!
//! sqlx 0.9 accepts only `&'static str` directly; a runtime-built string must
//! be wrapped in [`AssertSqlSafe`], which is a deliberate speed bump. Rather
//! than assert safety by argument, this module enforces it:
//!
//! * every interpolated identifier comes from the registry's `&'static str`
//!   literals — never from row content;
//! * each one is validated against `[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*` by [`SqlIdentifier`];
//! * each one is emitted quoted, so it can only ever be read as an identifier;
//! * a value that fails validation is rejected **before** any query string is
//!   built, and surfaces as [`AuditError::UnsafeIdentifier`].
//!
//! There is **no** exception. Row-identity columns are declared in the registry
//! too, so the live catalog is only ever an oracle: it says whether the
//! declared objects exist, carry the declared type and form the primary key. A
//! disagreement is `SCHEMA_RELATIONSHIP_DRIFT` and that table's scanner query
//! is not constructed at all. No name returned by the catalog is interpolated
//! into SQL, validated and quoted or otherwise.
