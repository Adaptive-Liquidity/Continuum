//! The semantic tenancy inventory: what every application table is, where its
//! tenant comes from, and when it may be migrated.
//!
//! Step 4A of the AEON authentication & tenancy plan. Step 4A is an
//! implementation subdivision derived from the frozen plan
//! (`Adaptive-Liquidity/nexus-planning @ b1fe06505d400e435c3ef8d10dc197f15641bebd`);
//! it is not a named section of that document.
//!
//! Two halves live here and they are deliberately different in kind:
//!
//! * [`REGISTRY`] is a **decision**. Every table is assigned a classification,
//!   exactly one canonical ownership path, any secondary paths that must agree
//!   with it, a migration tranche, and the constraint work Step 4B will owe.
//!   Nothing in it is inferred at runtime — that is the point. A table cannot
//!   acquire a tenancy decision by accident.
//! * [`discover`] is an **observation**. It reads the live PostgreSQL catalogs
//!   and reports what actually exists.
//!
//! The audit's first job is to hold those two against each other. A table that
//! exists but is unregistered, or is registered but does not exist, or is
//! registered twice, is a blocking finding — which is how a future migration
//! that adds a table is forced to make a tenancy decision rather than inherit
//! one.
//!
//! ## Why classification is not name-driven
//!
//! Almost every table in this schema carries a column called `agent_id`, and it
//! is **`TEXT`** — the legacy caller-facing identifier, not `agents.id`. Only
//! `credential_agent_grants` references the internal UUID, and it calls the
//! column `agent_uuid` precisely so the two cannot be confused. A classifier
//! that keyed on the column name would get almost every table wrong in the same
//! direction.
