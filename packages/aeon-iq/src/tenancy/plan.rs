//! The typed Step 4B migration contract.
//!
//! Step 4A produced the ownership map. This module turns the *plan* half of that
//! map from prose into data: every column, index, unique target, foreign key and
//! constraint Step 4B intends to create is a typed value with an owning tranche,
//! and the human-readable rendering in the artifacts is generated from those
//! values rather than hand-written beside them.
//!
//! The reason is not tidiness. The Step 4A plan carried its future schema as
//! strings like `"FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, agent_uuid) REFERENCES agents(tenant_id,
//! id)"`, and two foreign keys named a parent tuple that no planned unique target
//! covered — `archival_batches(id, tenant_id)` and `entities(id, tenant_id)`.
//! PostgreSQL rejects such a key outright, so both migrations would have failed on
//! first execution. Nothing could have caught it, because checking would have
//! meant parsing the prose. The invariants below now check it as data.
//!
//! ## What this module deliberately does not do
//!
//! It creates nothing. There is no DDL here, no migration file, and no backfill.
//! Step 4B-0 is the contract; Step 4B-1 onward executes against it.

     those silently reintroduces NULL ownership on new rows, and the failure surfaces later as \
     a SET NOT NULL that cannot succeed. The trigger is attached to the table, so it holds for \
     every writer including ones nobody enumerated, and it survives an application rollback \
     because it is schema rather than code. It is installed in PREPARE, before any backfill, \
     so no window exists in which new rows are unowned.";

     from agents using the row's legacy agent_id; when they arrive non-NULL and disagree with \
     what agents says for that agent_id, it raises. A legacy writer that supplies only agent_id \
     therefore produces a fully owned row, and a writer that supplies a wrong tenant is \
     rejected rather than silently believed. The one remaining case that yields NULL is an \
     agent whose own tenant_id is NULL, which is exactly UNMAPPED_AGENT and is already a \
