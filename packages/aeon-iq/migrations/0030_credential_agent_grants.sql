-- 0030  Agent grants  (AEON auth/tenancy plan §2.2, §10 step 3)
-- ============================================================================
--
-- Step 3 of the plan accepted at
--   Adaptive-Liquidity/nexus-planning @ b1fe06505d400e435c3ef8d10dc197f15641bebd
--
-- WHY THIS TABLE EXISTS
--
-- Tenant isolation and agent authorization are different controls, and the
-- first does not imply the second. Without this table, any valid `memory:read`
-- credential could name ANY agent in its own tenant and satisfy every route's
-- tenant+agent predicate — which is exactly the cross-agent hole plan test #5
-- forbids.
--
-- ADDITIVE AND INERT. Creates one table and two triggers. It alters no existing
-- column and rewrites no data. Nothing consults it on any request path: route
-- enforcement is plan step 5.
--
-- COLUMN NAMING — worth reading before extending this.
--
-- `agent_id` here is the UUID `agents.id`. It is NOT `agents.agent_id`, which
-- is the legacy caller-facing TEXT identifier that step 1 preserved. The plan's
-- §2.2 sketch calls this column `agent_uuid` precisely to keep the two apart;
-- the name `agent_id` is used here as specified for this step. The types differ
-- (UUID vs TEXT), so a mistaken join fails loudly rather than silently matching
-- the wrong thing — but a reader skimming the schema can still be misled, so:
-- this column joins `agents.id`, never `agents.agent_id`.

-- ── tenant_wide and grants are mutually exclusive ───────────────────────────
--
-- §2.2 requires a credential to be EITHER tenant-wide OR restricted to an
-- explicit agent set, never both. A credential holding `tenant_wide = true`
-- *and* grant rows asserts both "all agents" and "these agents"; resolving it
-- either way is worse than refusing, because resolving toward tenant-wide lets
-- a stray flag quietly widen a restricted credential, and resolving toward the
-- grants lets a flag intended as tenant-wide be silently narrowed.
--
-- The plan notes a CHECK cannot express this (a CHECK cannot subquery) and
-- suggests "a trigger or an application invariant plus a periodic audit".
-- Triggers are used here so the contradictory state is genuinely
-- unrepresentable rather than merely detected after the fact — the application
-- invariant in `grants.rs` is then a second line, not the only one.
--
-- CONCURRENCY, STATED RATHER THAN ASSUMED: under READ COMMITTED, two
-- concurrent transactions — one inserting a grant, one setting tenant_wide —
-- could each see a state the other is about to invalidate. The grant trigger
-- therefore takes `FOR SHARE` on the credential row, which conflicts with the
-- `FOR UPDATE` lock an `UPDATE credentials` already holds, so the two
-- serialise. (The foreign key's own `FOR KEY SHARE` is not enough: it does not
-- conflict with a non-key column update, and `tenant_wide` is a non-key
-- column.)
